## Current schedule
### June 11th, 15:00 - 16:00 China Standard Time (UTC+8) Wojciech Samotij (Tel Aviv University)
_**Large deviations of triangle counts in the binomial random graph I**_

Abstract: Suppose that Y_1, …, Y_N are i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) random variables and let X = Y_1 + … + Y_N. The classical theory of large deviations allows one to accurately estimate the probability of the tail events X < (1-c)E[X] and X > (1+c)E[X] for any positive c. However, the methods involved strongly rely on the fact that X is a linear function of the independent variables Y_1, …, Y_N. There has been considerable interest—both theoretical and practical—in developing tools for estimating such tail probabilities also when X is a nonlinear function of the Y_i. One archetypal example studied by both the combinatorics and the probability communities is when X is the number of triangles in the binomial random graph G(n,p).

Talk I: We will give a very gentle introduction to the theory of large deviations and discuss the history of the large deviation problem for triangle counts.

Talk II: We will present a complete solution to the upper tail problem for triangle counts in G(n,p) that was obtained recently in a joint work with Matan Harel and Frank Mousset.
