## Current schedule
### June 11th, 2020, 15:00 (UTC+8): [Wojciech Samotij](http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~samotij/) (Tel Aviv University) 
_**Large deviations of triangle counts in the binomial random graph I**_  
[zoom](https://zoom.com.cn/j/92368341744) and [poster](/poster/200611_Wojciech_Samotij.pdf)

Abstract: Suppose that Y_1, …, Y_N are i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) random variables and let X = Y_1 + … + Y_N. The classical theory of large deviations allows one to accurately estimate the probability of the tail events X < (1-c)E[X] and X > (1+c)E[X] for any positive c. However, the methods involved strongly rely on the fact that X is a linear function of the independent variables Y_1, …, Y_N. There has been considerable interest—both theoretical and practical—in developing tools for estimating such tail probabilities also when X is a nonlinear function of the Y_i. One archetypal example studied by both the combinatorics and the probability communities is when X is the number of triangles in the binomial random graph G(n,p).

Talk I: We will give a very gentle introduction to the theory of large deviations and discuss the history of the large deviation problem for triangle counts.

Talk II: We will present a complete solution to the upper tail problem for triangle counts in G(n,p) that was obtained recently in a joint work with Matan Harel and Frank Mousset.

### June 25th, 2020, 10:00 (UTC+8): [Lina Li](https://sites.google.com/view/linali/) (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)
_**Independent sets in middle two layers of Boolean lattice**_   
 
Abstract: In recent decades, independent sets in the discrete hypercube has received a lot of attention from many notable researchers.
The classical result of Korshunov and Sapozhenko in 1983 counts the number of independent sets in the hypercube, and then shows that typical independent sets are not far from the trivial construction.  
For an odd integer n=2d-1, let \mathcal{B}(n, d) be the subgraph of the hypercube induced by the two largest layers. 
Our new results describe the typical structure of independent sets in \mathcal{B}(n, d) and also give precise asymptotics on the number of them.   
The proofs use Sapozhenko's graph container lemma, and a recently developed method of Jenssen and Perkins, which combines Sapozhenko's graph container lemma with a classcal tool from statistical physics, the cluster expansion for polymer models.  
This is a joint work with Jozsef Balogh and Ramon I. Garcia.

## Past talks
### May 7th - June 4th, 2020: [Hong Liu](http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/H.Liu.9/) (University of Warwick) 
_**Basics on the hypergraph container method I - V**_   

This is a gentle introduction to basics of the hypergraph container method introduced independently by Balogh, Samotij and Morris, and Saxton and Thomason. The method has seen numerous applications in extremal combinatorics and other related areas in the past decade. We will focus mostly on examples, illustrating how to apply this method on various types of problems.
